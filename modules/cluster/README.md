# elasticache

[![Terraform actions status](https://github.com/techservicesillinois/terraform-aws-elasticache/workflows/terraform/badge.svg)](https://github.com/techservicesillinois/terraform-aws-elasticache/actions)

Provides an [AWS ElastiCache](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticache) replication group resource.

**Currently this module only supports the Redis engine.**

Example Usage
----------------

```hcl
module "elasticache" {
  source = "git@github.com:techservicesillinois/terraform-aws-elasticache//modules/cluster"

  engine             = "redis"
  engine_version     = "7.1"

  multi_az_enabled   = true
  name               = "service-name"
  node_type          = "cache.t4g.small"
  num_cache_clusters = 2

  # Maintenance window is expressed in UTC.
  maintenance_window = "fri:08:00-fri:09:00"

  # Snapshot window is expressed in UTC.
  snapshot_window = "06:00-07:00"

  network_configuration = {
    vpc                  = "my-vpc-name"
    subnet_id            = "private"
    security_group_names = ["service-redis-servers"]
  }
}
```
